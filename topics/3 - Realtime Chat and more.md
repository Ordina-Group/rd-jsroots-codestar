# Build a realtime chat and more

One of the more interesting things we can build between a frontend and backend, is a realtime integration. One of the easiest things to get working within a few hours would be a realtime Chat application, using technology like WebSockets. 

Of course, expanding a chat application with things like a realtime Hangman game, or reminder bots, or slowly expanding it out to a fully realtime game like multiplayer Wordle, is not beyond the realm of possibilities.
