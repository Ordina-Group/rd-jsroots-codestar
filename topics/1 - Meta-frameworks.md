# Meta-frameworks in a Enterprise world

In our daily jobs, working for mainly Enterprise companies, we see a lot of Java/Kotlin/Scala/.NET backend solutions paired with Frontend frameworks like React, Vue and Angular. 

However, modern frontend trends point to meta-frameworks surrounding these frontends, where we combine backend and frontend back into one repository and are able to build a startup or MVP within weeks, instead of months.

Let's try and answer the questions and explore the pros and cons of these trends, why they might work of our clients and where the benefits of our Java/Scala/Kotlin solutions lie towards our clients.

## Suggestions
Take a look at one or more of these:
1. NextJS (React) / NuxtJS (Vue)
2. AnalogJS (Angular)
3. SvelteKit (Svelte)
4. Remix (React ?)
5. ...

And compare these from both a frontend and backend perspective. Look at how you would implement a JSON REST endpoint in those, or how communication between front- and backend works from a single file. 

Perhaps we could build the same (small scale) app in a two of these solutions, and compare them to a similar Java project? A todo app, or perhaps a "Flight booking" app (Example here by Manfred Steyer: https://github.com/angular-architects/flight-app)
