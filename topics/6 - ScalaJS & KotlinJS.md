## ScalaJS & KotlinJS

Is there any feasability of making a proper (modern) frontend application, completely from Scala or Kotlin using ScalaJS or KotlinJS?

Can we build a prototype app to proof how complete and ready the technology is? What does the end result look like from a Frontend perspective (HTML/CSS/JS) and how much control do we have over the app?
