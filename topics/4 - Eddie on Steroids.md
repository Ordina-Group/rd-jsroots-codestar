# Eddie on (AI) steroids

We have Eddie as our central system for finding new opportunities at clients. However, the process of scanning for opportunities that fit your profile is tedious and slow. What if we could link our Eddie data (using some mocked data for local development) as it comes in, and automatically match it using AI like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Embeddings to our (mocked data) employees and their expertise and skillsets? 

What if it could even generate a customized resumé for a specific job application, based on an existing resumé?
